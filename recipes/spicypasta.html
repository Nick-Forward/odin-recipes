        This spicy spaghetti recipe is one that I make <em>all</em> the time. It's simple, easy,
        and surprisingly delicious. It's best served fresh, but can store in the freezer up to three 
        months and can be re-heated easily.

        <li>Heat a high-walled saucepan to medium-high heat. Cover bottom of pan with olive oil.
             Once the pan is up to temperature,
            add italian sausage links to the pan. Heat until nearly cooked through and the outside
            is a rich golden-brown, about 10 minutes

            While the sausage is cooking, mince garlic and measure out red pepper flakes. Once sausage
            is nearly cooked through, add Garlic and red pepper flake and fry in oil for one minute, stirring constantly
        </li>

            After Garlic is browned and oil is fragrent from red pepper flake, add in 28 oz. can of tomatoes followered by
            the two tablespoons of honey. Stir to ensure garlic is off the bottom of the pan.
