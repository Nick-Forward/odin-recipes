### odin-recipes
Nick Forward Odin Recipes Project
This project is intended for me to practice the workflow of Git, 
as well as practice building a basic HTML webpage. 
HTML functionalities used include creating links, images
seperate pages, as well as basic HTML formatting/syntax.
For Git, this project is intended to give me practice
with the Git workflow, as well as practice writing 
descriptive, succinct commit messages.
